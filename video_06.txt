I think it's really important to be
scared that's the only thing which
avoids that you die my name is Jose
Schultz I'm from Germany and I'm an
extreme hero cyclist
when people see me unicycling in the
mountains they don't understand how it
can be possible so it's usually like oh
what's up when you have never written on
one it feels impossible for you
the Unica that I use is special that has
many stuff I have grippy pedals a bigger
tire to absorb jumps for comfortable
seat the parts part of unicycling is to
start
it's only about the downhill if there's
a cliff to the left if I fall I fall to
the right and not to the left also a
little bit of risk calculation
I got many YouTubers for a heart on my
head I broke a peach I broke my arm I
have also to sing it's a hospital close
by I have to check Google Maps there's a
lot of research my parents hate it so I
I really like the steam unicycling

Pro athlete Lutz Eichholz has been competing in mountain unicycling for more than a decade. This extreme sport requires intense balance, quick-thinking, and knowledge of the nearest hospitals, but Eichholz loves the challenge. @lutzeichholz
